PAXChecker
==========


Features include:

-PAX Prime, East, South and Aus scanning capability

-Get into queue before the Twitter notification! (This may change at any given time, but as far as I know you most likely will)

-Text as many phones as you want when queue is found (along with a link for if you don't have access to your computer!) (Standard messaging rates probably apply, but it's basically just a text message -- if you have unlimited texting you're most likely good)

-Can use any cell carrier that supports email text messages

-Program supports Yahoo! and GMail for sending texts (GMail highly recommended. Other emails may be used -- see the in-program Instructions for how to set this up)

-Specify how often to check for tickets (10-60 seconds, to reduce request spamming and data usage)

-Track how much data is used
